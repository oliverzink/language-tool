The goal for this project was to create a language learning tool chrome extension that I will use daily. Languify allows you to learn a foreign language passively by substituting foreign words into any webpage. From using this tool I have picked up on a lot of new spanish words and it feels really cool to be learning a language while going about my daily life rather than setting aside time to do so. 

View the video demo below. The green highlighted words were translated into the selected language (spanish in this demo) and substituted back in.

Please note that because this program uses the Google Cloud API, I unfortunately do not have a way of publishing it onto the chrome extension store at the moment (the API calls cost money and I currently dont have time to set up a payment structure, maybe that will be a future project!). Feel free to download the code and substitute your own API key in, it should work great that way.
